Microstom is a minimal minecraft server with [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) as its core.

Microstom seeks to be a minimal implementation of a Minestom server.
So it should not include any feature that could have been implemented in an extension.
Every piece of content has to be added as extension, (almost) nothing is there by default.

## Install
You could either just download a [release](https://github.com/KlainStom/microstom/releases) or you compile the server yourself using the following commands under Linux
```shell
git clone https://github.com/KlainStom/microstom.git
cd microstom
./gradlew build
```
The server jar will be located at `build/libs/Microstom-<VERSION>.jar`.

Note that for compiling you need to use a JDK ~~17~~ 21.

## Usage
To run the server you need to have a Java ~~17~~ 21 runtime installed.
Use the following command to start the server for the first time.
```shell
java -jar Microstom-<VERSION>.jar
```
This generates a `start.sh` script and a settings file with these default values:
```json5
{
  "SERVER_IP": "localhost",
  "SERVER_PORT": 25565,
  "MODE": "OFFLINE", // may be OFFLINE, ONLINE, BUNGEECORD or VELOCITY
  "VELOCITY_SECRET": "",
  "TPS": null, // default 20
  "CHUNK_VIEW_DISTANCE": null, // default 8
  "ENTITY_VIEW_DISTANCE": null, // default 5
  "TERMINAL_DISABLED": false // default false
}
```
You have to restart the server for changes in there to take effect.

Note that this server only supports 1.21.4. To allow other/multiple versions to connect you need to use a proxy with plugins like ViaVersion.

## Restarting
Restarting the server calls the `./start.sh` or `./start.bat` script.
The generated script will restart the server with no way to access the console.
So keep in mind that you will need an extension providing remote access or use tmux/screen in the `start.sh` to access the console.


## API
This server itself does not add some API. But it features [Minestom's API](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) so you can use it from within extensions.
